Fantasy football season approacheth.  Your heart longs to analyze the scoring distribution in your league by week, by team, by player --- to finally quantitatively question the predictive power of projected points --- to confirm your hypothesis that you got an unfair slate of opponents in the pre-playoff weeks ... and yet you know not how.  Copy-paste data from a webpage?  Do some expert-level web scraping?

You're in luck.  ESPN has an accessible, though undocumented, API for their Fantasy football database.  This means you can query a question like "what was the score of the week 1 game between ABC and XYZ" directly with a GET request and some JSON fiddling, no web "scraping" required.  

Since the API is mysteriously undocumented, in this blog I'll write down everything I've learned about the API, how to access different parts of it, and how to do that in Python and R.  *EDIT* In a follow-on post, I'll show [how to get boxscores](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-2-python.html), and then [how to deal with private leagues](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-3-python.html).  Here's a boxplot we'll produce:

Before we get started, let the reader note there's already a Python package out there that do a lot of what I describe below in a clean way: [`espnff`](https://github.com/rbarton65/espnff).   So you can skip the hassle and just use this excellent work.  My feeling is: I'd rather bake my own janky cake with all the toppings I want than buy the tasty more attractive cake from the store. 

You should also check out my friend [Dusty Turner](https://twitter.com/dtdusty)'s excellent [post about ESPN Fantasy scraping](https://dusty-turner.netlify.com/post/mathlete-fantasy-football-analysis/) in R, and this [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/56u8bc/espn_fantasy_football_api_wrapper_for_python_3/) about the ESPN Fantasy API.

**CAVEAT:** your league needs to be "public", or you need to figure out how to send session cookies or login remotely, see end of this post.

## Looking at scores (in Python)

Let's start with Python.  Using the `requests` package for our GET request, let's tap into the ESPN Fantasy API through the `scoreboard` endpoint:

```python
import requests

scores = {}
for week in range(1, 17):
    r = requests.get('http://games.espn.com/ffl/api/v2/scoreboard', 
                     params={'leagueId': 123456, 'seasonId': 2017, 'matchupPeriodId': week})
    scores[week] = r.json()
```

Let's walk through this line by line.  Import the `requests` package.  Initialize a `dict` called `scores` to hold score information.  Loop over weeks 1-16.  Do a `GET` request to the API at `http://games.espn.com/ffl/api/v2/` with the endpoint `scoreboard`, and with parameters for the league ID, season, and matchup period.  To find your league ID, check the URL when you're on your league's page.  Note: if we don't specify the matchup period, it will default to the last week.  Finally, store that week's score information in `scores` as a `dict` in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format.

The GET request above, with parameters, is essentially equivalent to if you entered the following URL into a browser:

`http://games.espn.com/ffl/api/v2/scoreboard?leagueId=123456&seasonId=2017&matchupPeriodId=1`

and then saved the resulting text (which notice is in a JSON format).

It is worth poking around this nested collection of information.  Here's an abbreviated sample of `scores[1]`:

```
{'metadata': { ... },
 'scoreboard': {'dateFirstProGameOfScoringPeriod': '2017-09-08T00:30:00.000Z',
  'matchupPeriodId': 1,
  'matchups': [{'bye': False,
    'teams': [{'home': True,
      'playerIDs': [ ... ],
      'score': 81,
      'team': {'division': {'divisionId': 0,
        'divisionName': 'Division 1',
        'size': 5},
       'record': { ... },
       'teamAbbrev': 'ABCD',
       'teamId': 5,
       'teamLocation': 'Team ',
       'teamNickname': 'Smith',
       'waiverRank': 2},
      'teamId': 5}, ... ],
    'winner': 'away'},
   ... ]}
```

There is a ton of information stored here already, and we're only using one endpoint!  We'll focus on scores for now, but at the end of this post, I'll mention some other potential here such as those `playerIDs` (i.e. the players on each team, by week!).

To extract the first matchup of week 1, we would do `scores[1]['scoreboard']['matchups'][0]`.  To extract the home score for this matchup, we would index deeper and call `scores[1]['scoreboard']['matchups'][0]['teams'][0]['score']`.  To make a clean table of all the team IDs, names, and scores for all weeks, we can do
```python
df = []
for key in scores:
    temp = scores[key]['scoreboard']['matchups']
    for match in temp:
        df.append([key, 
                   match['teams'][0]['team']['teamAbbrev'],
                   match['teams'][1]['team']['teamAbbrev'],
                   match['teams'][0]['score'],
                   match['teams'][1]['score']])
```

I'd like to start visualizing this information with `matplotlib`, and to make our lives easier let's bring `numpy`, `pandas` and `seaborn` to the mix.

```python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
```

(The `matplotlib inline` is some magic to get inline plots in a Jupyter notebook, omit if you are working in another setting.)

Now we can save our table as a pandas `DataFrame`, let's take a look at it:
```python
df = pd.DataFrame(df, columns=['Week', 'HomeAbbrev', 'AwayAbbrev', 'HomeScore', 'AwayScore'])
df.head()
```

Let's get rid of the (let's admit, completely arbitrary) home-away distinction and just get a dataframe of all scores by team.  Let's also add a categorical variable `Type` for whether the game was regular season or playoff.

```python
df = (df[['Week', 'HomeAbbrev', 'HomeScore']]
      .rename(columns={'HomeAbbrev': 'Abbrev', 'HomeScore': 'Score'})
      .append(df[['Week', 'AwayAbbrev', 'AwayScore']]
             .rename(columns={'AwayAbbrev': 'Abbrev', 'AwayScore': 'Score'}))
     )
df['Type'] = pd.Series(['Regular' if w<=14 else 'Playoff' for w in df['Week']])
```

To protect the innocent, I renamed all the teams "A", "B", "C", ...  Here's my `df.head()`
```
	Week	Abbrev	Score	Type
0	1	I	81	Regular
1	1	G	126	Regular
2	1	F	69	Regular
3	1	J	61	Regular
4	1	A	99	Regular
```

Now we do some plots.  Let's look at a violin plot of scores, by player, regular/playoff game, and ordered by final standing (which I conveniently already ensured was in alphabetical order, but of course you could specify any order you want, like `['BOB', 'ANN', ...]`).
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(16,6))
sns.violinplot(x='Abbrev', y='Score', hue='Type',
               data=df,
               palette='muted', 
               order=list('ABCDEFGHIJ'))
ax.set_xlabel('')
ax.set_title('Distribution of score, ordered by final standing')
plt.show()
```

<img align="center" width="100%" src="{{ site.github.url }}/images/fantasy_violin.png" alt="Violin Plot of fantasy scores">

If you change `violinplot` to `boxplot` in the above code, you'll get the image at the start of this blog.

A few stories here:  high scorers are unsurprisingly in higher standing than low scorers.  Consistency doesn't seem to matter much, as there are high variance teams at top and bottom.  But playoff performance absolutely does matter for the playoff teams (in this case, top 4) --- in fact, Player D entered the playoffs as top seed and finished 4th.  Player E had the best playoff performance but had too many mediocre games in the regular season.  All tales as old as time.




## Doing it in R

I thought about redoing the above process in R, but realized [@DTDusty](https://twitter.com/dtdusty) already did it better: check out his blog [over here](https://dusty-turner.netlify.com/post/mathlete-fantasy-football-analysis/).  Here's a teaser pic, whose filename let the reader note is `dusty_fantasy.png` ...

## Other endpoints, private leagues...

Another rabbit hole to explore is the various other "endpoints" to the API besides `scoreboard`.  Here's several that I know about:

* leagueSettings
* playerInfo
* scoreboard
* player/news
* recentActivity
* leagueSchedules
* teams
* rosterInfo
* schedule
* polls
* messageboard
* status
* teams/pendingMoveBatches
* tweets
* stories
* livescoring (doesn't seem to be working right)
* boxscore

Each of these can be appended to the ESPN API URL and be explored.  

I'm most interested in `boxscore` which contains the weekly points by player.  However, it only returns the full information if you are logged into an account, which I've been unable to do through a GET request.  Try it: log in to your ESPN account, and then enter the API URL

`http://games.espn.com/ffl/api/v2/boxscore?leagueId=123456&seasonId=2017&matchupPeriodId=1`

with your league ID.  All the desired info will pop up.  Now try through a GET request and you'll get basically an empty dict.  This indicates there is some cookie/swid/other stuff being passed behind the scenes for this endpoint.  It is possible to send `espn_s2` cookies, `swid`, and other info in the GET request, but I haven't gotten these to work.   If you've cracked the code on this, please let me know.

**EDIT:** I think it be as simple as adding a `teamId` parameter, but more to follow in a later post ...

**EDIT2:** It was: check out the follow-on posts on [how to get boxscores](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-2-python.html), and then [how to deal with private leagues](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-3-python.html).

Hope this has been enjoyable, good luck this season!
