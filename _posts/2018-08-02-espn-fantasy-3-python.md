This is the third (and probably last) of 3 posts (here's the [first one](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-python.html) and [second one](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-2-python.html)) on pulling info from ESPN Fantasy.  This post focuses on how to pass personal session cookies in order to access info otherwise hidden behind a login.  **Caveat:** to my knowledge there is nothing prohibited about passing one's own personal cookies over a GET request, but you should review [ESPN's API Terms of Use](http://www.espn.com/static/apis/devcenter/terms.html) yourself and obviously not provide your cookies to a third-party.


# The Right Cookie

A lot of the ESPN Fantasy tools are behind a login-wall.  Since accounts are free, this is not a huge deal, but becomes slightly annoying for GET requests because now we somehow need to "login" through the request.  One way to do this is to send session cookies along with the request.  Again this can take us into a gray area, but to my knowledge there is nothing prohibited about using your own cookies for personal use within your own league.

Specifically, our GET request [from the previous post](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-2-python.html) is modified to look like, for example:
```python
r = requests.get('http://games.espn.com/ffl/api/v2/scoreboard', 
                 params={'leagueId': 123456, 'seasonId': 2017, 'matchupPeriodId': 1},
                 cookies={'swid': '{SWID-COOKIE-HERE}',
                 		  'espn_s2': 'LONG_ESPN_S2_COOKIE_HERE'})
```

This should return the info you want even for a private league.  I saw that the [SWID](https://tagvault.org/swid-tags/what-are-swid-tags/) and the ESPN_S2 cookies were the magic tickets based on the similar coding endeavors [here](https://github.com/rbarton65/espnff) and [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/espn-ff-api) and [here](https://fantasyfootballanalytics.net/2016/06/ffanalytics-r-package-fantasy-football-data-analysis.html).

You can find these cookies in Safari by opening the Storage tab of Developer tools (you can turn on developer tools in preferences), and looking under `espn.com` in the Cookies folder.  In Chrome, you can go to Preferences -> Advanced -> Content Settings -> Cookies -> See all cookies and site data, and looking for ESPN. 


# Case Study: Free Agent stats

Besides accessing the API endpoints for private leagues, passing session cookies allows us to "scrape" data from other league sites.  For example, the player stats page.  This is valuable because it gives us historical data on **all** players, not just the few that happened to be on rosters in a given week (which we can get through the `boxscore` endpoint, see [previous post](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-2-python.html)).

The page we're interested in is `http://games.espn.com/ffl/leaders?leagueId=123&seasonId=2017`, the weekly leaderboard.  Adding [`BeautifulSoup`](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-scrape-websites-with-python-and-beautifulsoup-5946935d93fe) to the list of libraries from the previous posts, let's just pull QBs from week 1:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

r = requests.get('http://games.espn.com/ffl/leaders',
                     params={'leagueId': 12356, 'seasonId': 2017, 
                             'scoringPeriodId': 1,
                             'slotCategoryId': 0},
                     cookies={'SWID': swid, 'espn_s2': espn})
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')
table = soup.find('table', class_='playerTableTable')
tdf = pd.read_html(str(table), flavor='bs4')[0]  # returns a list of df's, grab first
```

Line by line, this imports the `BeautifulSoup` library from `bs4` which is a high-level HTML/CSS handler (so we can avoid some nasty text scraping of the raw HTML in `r.content`).  Then we do the request to the leaderboard page, being sure to pass cookies.  We create `soup`, a `BeautifulSoup` object that allows us to `soup.find` the HTML table with class `playerTableTable` which I happen to know is the class of the table we want (discovered by skimming the page source).

Lastly, we give a raw-string version of this table to `pandas`, which works some magic and turns it into a `DataFrame`.

We get:
```
	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	...	17	18	19	20	21	22	23	24	25	26
0	OFFENSIVE PLAYERS	NaN	STATUS	NaN	WK 1	NaN	PASSING	NaN	RUSHING	NaN	...	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN
1	PLAYER, TEAM POS	NaN	TYPE	ACTION	NaN	OPP	STATUS ET	NaN	C/A	YDS	...	REC	YDS	TD	TAR	NaN	2PC	FUML	TD	NaN	PTS
2	Alex Smith, Wsh QB	NaN	FA	NaN	NaN	Phi	L 17-30	NaN	28/35	368	...	0	0	0	0	NaN	0	0	0	NaN	54
3	Matthew Stafford, Det QB	NaN	BREW	NaN	NaN	Ari	W 35-23	NaN	29/41	292	...	0	0	0	0	NaN	0	0	0	NaN	39
4	Sam Bradford, Ari QB	NaN	FA	NaN	NaN	@Det	L 23-35	NaN	27/32	346	...	0	0	0	0	NaN	0	0	0	NaN	37
```

All we want for now is player name (col 0), team/FA status (2), and total points for the week (26).  A bit of wrangling:
```python
tdf = tdf.iloc[2:, [0,2,26]].reset_index(drop=True)
tdf.columns = ['Player', 'Owner', 'Pts']
tdf['Pts'] = tdf['Pts'].fillna(0).astype('int')
tdf['Player'] = tdf['Player'].str.split(',').str[0]  # keep just player name
tdf['Week'] = 1
```

Wrap this in a loop and get every week for the season:
```python
leagueId, seasonId = 123456, 2017
slot = 0

df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Player', 'Owner', 'Pts', 'Week'])

print('Week ', end='')
for week in range(1, 17):
    print('%d .. ' % week, end='')
    
    # do first two "pages" of results
    for si in [0, 50]:
        r = requests.get('http://games.espn.com/ffl/leaders',
                         params={'leagueId': leagueId, 'seasonId': seasonId, 
                                 'scoringPeriodId': week,
                                 'slotCategoryId': slot,
                                 'startIndex': si},
                         cookies={'SWID': swid, 'espn_s2': espn})
        soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')
        table = soup.find('table', class_='playerTableTable')
        tdf = pd.read_html(str(table), flavor='bs4')[0]  # returns a list of df's, grab first

        tdf = tdf.iloc[2:, [0,2,26]].reset_index(drop=True)
        tdf.columns = ['Player', 'Owner', 'Pts']
        tdf['Pts'] = tdf['Pts'].fillna(0).astype('int')
        tdf['Player'] = tdf['Player'].str.split(',').str[0]  # keep just player name
        tdf['Week'] = week

        df = df.append(tdf)
print('Complete.')
```

This gives:
```
	Player			Owner	Pts		Week
0	Alex Smith		FA		54.0	1.0
1	Matthew Stafford BBB	39.0	1.0
2	Sam Bradford	FA		37.0	1.0
3	Carson Wentz	JJ		32.0	1.0
4	Matt Ryan		JJ		30.0	1.0
```

You could easily add a loop to grab multiple seasons and really try to do some forecasting based on long-term trends .... sounds like a real project.  For now, let's look at the distribution of total points, and whether the player was actually a consistent starter or one of those waiver wire gems that got picked up late (or never at all?).  First we might make some summary stats
```python
cstats = (df.groupby('Player')
 .agg({'Pts': 'mean'})
 .reset_index()
 .rename(columns={'Pts': 'Avg pts'}))
cstats['FA'] = (df.groupby('Player')['Owner']
 .apply(lambda x: x[x=='FA'].count())
 .as_matrix())
cstats.head()
```
```
	Player	Avg pts	FA
0	AJ McCarron	0.133333	15
1	Aaron Murray	0.000000	15
2	Aaron Rodgers	11.933333	0
3	Alex Smith	26.000000	3
4	Alex Tanney	0.000000	15
```

This gives the overall average points and the number of weeks the player was on the waiver wire (out of 15 possible, since fantasy usually stops a week early and teams have a bye).

We can use this to do a boxplot viz of point distribution, colored by whether the player was on a roster for at least half the season or not.  And thus was born another `matplotlib`/`seaborn` mashup, with a loop and a dummy scatter plot because I couldn't figure out how to make this happen using `FacetGrid`!

```python
cz = cstats[cstats['Avg pts'] >= 10]
z = df[df['Player'].isin(cz['Player'])]
z = pd.merge(z, cz, on='Player', how='outer')
z['FA'] = pd.cut(z['FA'], bins=2, labels=['Season starter', 'Waiver wire'])

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(12,10))
for i, c, lab in [(0,'royalblue','Season starter'), (1, 'aliceblue', 'Waiver wire')]:
    sns.boxplot(data=z[z['FA']==lab],
                x='Pts', y='Player',
                color=c,
                order=cz.sort_values('Avg pts')['Player'],
                orient='h',
                ax=ax)
    ax.scatter([], [], c=c, edgecolors='k', label=lab)  # dummy for legend

ax.legend()
ax.set(xlabel='Points', ylabel='',
       title='Player Scores (Season starters vs. waiver wire)')
```

Look at how many good-to-great QBs were on the waiver wire (in this league) for over half the season!
