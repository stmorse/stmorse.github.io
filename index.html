<hr>

<p>I'm a PhD student in <a href="https://www.wm.edu/cdsp/">Data Science</a> at the College of William & Mary and an active-duty infantry officer in the U.S. Army.  I maintain this website primarily as an outlet for personal and professional research, with a focus on applied math and statistics. </p>

<p>Following my PhD, I'll serve as senior faculty in the <a href="https://www.westpoint.edu/academics/departments/mathematical-sciences">Department of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="https://www.westpoint.edu/">U.S. Military Academy</a> (West Point), where I've previously served as an assistant professor.  I did my master's in the <a href="http://orc.mit.edu">Operations Research Center</a> at MIT, where I did research in complex networks with MIT's (now UC-Berkley's) <a href="https://humnetlab.berkeley.edu/">HuMNet Lab</a> and the <a href="http://www.draper.com">Draper Laboratory</a>.</p>
