<p>I am an instructor in the <a href="http://www.usma.edu/math">Department of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="http://www.usma.edu">U.S. Military Academy</a> (West Point), where I currently teach multivariable calculus.  I did my graduate (master's) program in the <a href="http://orc.mit.edu">Operations Research Center</a> at MIT, where I did research in complex networks with MIT's <a href="http://humnet.mit.edu">HuMNet Lab</a> and the <a href="http://www.draper.com">Draper Laboratory</a>.  You can read more about my ongoing research <a href="https://stmorse.github.io/research.html">here</a>.

<p>I am also an active-duty military officer.  I commissioned in 2008 from West Point, and have served in Afghanistan as a rifle platoon leader, and Kuwait as an infantry company commander.  I've held various staff positions at the Company, Brigade, and Division level.  After completing my tour as a West Point instructor, I plan to return to the operational Army and running around in the woods with guns.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about guitar, piano, hiking, traveling, languages, chess, hunting, reading, and good bourbon.  My backup career plan is to professionally busk.  I recently co-authored a neural network with my wife; he loves blueberries, counting to ten, and playing at the park.</p>
